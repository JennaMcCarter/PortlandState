##Planner

###Objective
Itâ€™s July and for many people this is the time of the year to begin planning the next year. What classes will you be taking? How will those classes fulfill your desire to graduate when you want. Is there a particular degree program you are interested in applying do and when are those application dates? Many programs require either spring or early summer application submissions. Now is the time to plan for the next year!
