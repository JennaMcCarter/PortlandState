##Planner

###Objective
It’s July and for many people this is the time of the year to begin planning the next year. What classes will you be taking? How will those classes fulfill your desire to graduate when you want. Is there a particular degree program you are interested in applying do and when are those application dates? Many programs require either spring or early summer application submissions. Now is the time to plan for the next year!

* Type of planned event (e.g., planning a class, submitting an application)
* Term when it is significant (e.g., Fall, Winter, Spring, Summer)
* Year when it is significant (e.g., 2014, 2015)
* Information about what you need to do to prepare (e.g., buy textbooks
online, ask for references, etc.)
* Contingencies (e.g., what happens if the class is full and you can’t take it, is there another class to take? What happens if you are not accepted to the program, is there another program/school you want to apply to?) 
* Optional other information
* be sure to use arrays of structures and external data files
