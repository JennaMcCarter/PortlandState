##Useful Functions

###Objective
There are many useful functions in the cctype library, such as toupper, tolower, isupper and islower. However, each of these are C language functions and do not support pass by reference nor do they support capitalizing arrays. Your job is to create a small collection of useful C++ functions that will help you in the future to manipulate arrays of characters. For this assignment you may NOT use other functions from the cctype library to do your job for you. The only library allowed for this assignment is the iostream library.

* Capitalize only the first letter of an array (e.g., “this is fun” would become “This is fun”
* Capitalize the first letter in each word in an array of characters (e.g., “this is fun” would become “This Is Fun”
* Turn each letter in an array to upper case (e.g., “this is fun” would become “THIS IS FUN”
* Only capitalize the first letter after a period, exclamation point, or question mark (e.g., “how great! this is fun. right? yep” would become “how great! This is fun. Right? Yep”
* Compare two arrays to see if they have the same contents, independent of their case (“HI” and “hi” would result in a match).
