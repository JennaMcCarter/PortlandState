##Alarm CLock

###Objective
The objective of this project was to create an alarm that could let you set the time for the alarm, turn the alarm on/off, add or subtract time to the alarm (in hours, minutes, and seconds), and display current time.

The program involved six tasks:
*Prompt and read from the user for the alarm time
* Echo the time read in
* Read in any adjustments to the time
* Calculate the appropriate revision to the alarm time and display
* Ask the user if they are ready to turn on/off the alarm
* Continue allowing adjustments to be made until the user wants to quit
